# Second Project for the TOP Curriculum

In this project I will be building a *landing
page* using HTML & CSS based on two references;
an image of the main page and a style guide.

After building & styling the main design,
I'll customize the page based on my taste
and will modify the styles accordingly.

Odin, please endow me with your power
& knowledge and unleash my creativity!
